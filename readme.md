# Remote Control

This app is a small coffeescript/node.js app that exposes a HTTP volume control interface for Mac OS X computers.

It works over websockets and updates connected clients in realtime when they adjust the volume.

Run it on the computer you are using to watch streaming video.  Point your browser at that computer's ip and port and adjust the volume to your heart's content!
