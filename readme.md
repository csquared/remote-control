# Remote Control

This app is a small coffeescript/node.js app that exposes a HTTP volume control interface for Mac OS X computers.

It works over websockets and updates connected clients in realtime when they adjust the volume.

Run it on the computer you are using to watch streaming video.  Connect via http://<ip>:<port> and adjust the volume to your heart's content!
